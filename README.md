Random Password Validator and Generator as a project provides a tool for the users to validate and generate passwords, the project contains Password Validator and Password Generator. Password Validator allows user to validate/invalidate any random input password which works on several constrains to check a password for validity.

1.	Why I choose this project?
I choose this project because it gave me the opportunity to learn project development in Java and GUI based project development. The project provided me with the opportunity to develop my own code to generate validate and generate passowrds and with it understand various nuances of dealing with errors and their resolutions.

2.	How is my project better than other projects?
My project is better than other projects in the same field as other projects are either password generators or password validators, but my project contains both password validator and generator, also, either a project is GUI based or Console based but I implemented my project for GUI as well as Console and my password generator generates validable password which many password generator projects donâ€™t, apart from that I believe that every project should be encouraged and everyone works hard towards their project.
